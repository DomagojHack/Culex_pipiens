# culex_pipiens

main structure and some content is based on AmP script for Aedes aegypti

Partially modified from *Aedes aegypti* to *Culex pipiens*:

- mydata_Culex_pipiens.m

Still same as *Aedes aegypti*

- pars_init_Culex_pipiens.m
- predict_Culex_pipiens.m

.gitignore is ignoring "papers" folder where I store reference papers.
